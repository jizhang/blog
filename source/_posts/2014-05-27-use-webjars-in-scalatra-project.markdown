As I'm working with my first [Scalatra][1] project, I automatically think of using [WebJars][2] to manage Javascript library dependencies, since it's more convenient and seems like a good practice. Though there's no [official support][3] for Scalatra framework, the installation process is not very complex. But this doesn't mean I didn't spend much time on this. I'm still a newbie to Scala, and there's only a few materials on this subject.
